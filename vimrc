" Hints & Tips {{{

" Creates a new empty function (this keeps you in insert mode and typing!).
" map! ,f function() {<CR>}<ESC>k$a<CR>

" Commands I should use more:
" == correct indentation of current line; gg=G corrects indentation for entire file
" =a{ correct indentation of current block (also =% if u'r on the {)
" gi - goes back to last insert
" '. - goes to the last modification
" CTRL+E & Y (ins mod) - inserts chars from above and below line
" CTRL+T & D - indent and dedent in ins mod
" ; to repeat fX or FX
" :!sort, :!grep, :!
" :.! - execute system command and add output on the current line

" In order to copy a text from Vim to your clipboard for other application to
" use, select the text you want to copy in visual mode, and then press "+y. This
" way, you can easily paste your text to other applications.
