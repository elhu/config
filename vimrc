" --- Maybe I can use this to run tests in background
" When working on a project where the build process is slow I always build in the background
" and pipe the output to a file called errors.err (something like make debug 2>&1 | tee errors.err).
" This makes it possible for me to continue editing or reviewing the source code during the build process.
" When it is ready (using pynotify on GTK to inform me that it is complete) I can look at the result in vim
" using quickfix. Start by issuing :cf[ile] which reads the error file and jumps to the first error.
" I personally like to use cwindow to get the build result in a separate window.
